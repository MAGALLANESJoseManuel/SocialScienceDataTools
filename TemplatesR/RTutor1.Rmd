R TUTORIAL (I)
========================================================
```{r echo=FALSE, set-options }
options(width = 320)
```
This is our first "basic" step-by-step tutorial where I will simply show how to collect some data,

In general, social data appear in a spreadsheet-like format, where different columns can have different **types** of values, that is *numeric* and *string*, while numeric can also represent different *scales*.However, data collected from social events may not follow a strict protocol and may bring some challenges when we need to work on it.For instance, take a look at the image below:

 * Source:<a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_border_wars' target='_blank'>WIKIPEDIA</a>

Anyway, if the source is idenytified and it looks like the image above we have several options using R. First we can think of copying and pasting the data into an **MSExcel** file, where we can save it as **csv**. If the data is in that format, we can get it quickly with a simple command:

```{r}
setwd("~/Documents/GITHUBrepositories/Tutorials/TemplatesR")
DATA_LocalFile=read.csv("warI.csv")
head(DATA_LocalFile)
```

It is sometimes a good idea to store it in **GoogleDrive** so that you do not depend on your hard drive availability, as shown below:

You can see the previous steps in <a href="http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2009/09/how-to-use-a-google-spreadsheet-as-data-in-r.html" target="_blank">http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/</a>.  
In our case, the proces is:
```{r}
require(RCurl)
CsvGDocs <- getURL("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AhVqDdZgThPldEZpWlc2Z3FuVm8taTlBVlc1a3VnT2c&output=csv")
DATA_Gdocs=read.csv(textConnection(CsvGDocs))
head(DATA_Gdocs)
```

There are other alternatives as **dropbox**, but a much better one could be  **GitHub**, where not only your data can be stored, but specially your code:
```{r}
library(RCurl)
DATA_Github <- getURL("https://raw.github.com/MAGALLANESJoseManuel/SocialScienceDataTools/master/TemplatesR/warI.csv")
DATA_git <- read.csv(text = DATA_Github)
head(DATA_git)
```
We can also get the table from where it has been published (Wikipedia):
```{r}
Link = 'http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_border_wars'
whichTable=3
library(XML)
wikiDataWWW = getNodeSet(htmlParse(Link), "//table")[[whichTable]]
DATA_www = readHTMLTable(wikiDataWWW)
head(DATA_www)
```

Evidently, some more work may be needed, we will see that later.
